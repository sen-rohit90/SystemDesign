# Notes

Let's look at some of the definitions and use cases: 

## What are Rules and Scripts?

Small segments of programmatic code which control or influence system behavior, allowing you to customize certain operations to meet your business needs. Rules and scripts are used throughout IdentityIQ to:
    

-   Define values in forms and provisioning policies
    
-   Define logic in workflow steps
    
-   Control the behavior or contents of certifications
    
-   Perform calculations or data manipulations in aggregation tasks
    
-   Manage or manipulate provisioning requests

## Scripts? 

Lines of code that are embedded within objects to perform logic only within the scope of a single usage

## Rules? 

Lines of code that are independent objects which can be referenced and re-used by multiple processes.

## What are the capabilities required?

One would either need System Administrator capability or the EditScripts  SPRight (8.3 onwards) to edit inline scripts. 
The **EditScripts** SPRight is not included in any standard capabilities by default. If you want to give script editing abilities to users other than System Administrators, you must either create a new capability for these users that includes the **EditScripts** SPRight, or add the **EditScripts** SPRight to an existing capability that can be assigned to those users.

## What language is used?

BeanShell is the language used for rules and scripts. It is an interpreted language that uses Java-like syntax. (Lightweight scripting for Java) BeanShell provides several conveniences for the script-writing process, like loose typing of variables and the implicit import of key java classes. BeanShell dynamically executes standard Java syntax and extends it with common scripting conveniences such as loose types, commands, and method closures like those in Perl and JavaScript.

## What is context argument?
The context argument is a SailPointContext object, the entry point into the SailPoint API – giving you methods for accessing other objects and interacting with the SailPoint database.

## What is log argument?
The log argument is a Logger object, which lets you use Log4j, the same logging utility used by the IdentityIQ core product, to generate logging messages from your rules.

## What are Rule returns?
Rules often also return values which are used by the process that invoked them. Most of the time, rules require a certain type of value to be returned – that is, the IdentityIQ system is expecting a specific type of return value when a rule of that type is called. For example, a rule defining a policy violation owner is expected to return an identity object.

## How Are Rules Created? 
### 1. Using Rule UI Editor
- To edit an existing rule, first select the rule, then click the [...] button to open the Rule Editor.

- To create a new rule, click the [...] button without selecting an existing rule, and a blank Rule Editor window is opened where you can create a new rule.
	#### 	Rule Editor Fields
	The Rule Editor uses these fields to define the rule and its business logic:

	- Copy From Existing Rule

		If you want to reuse existing code in your new rule, select an existing rule to copy.

	- Rule Name

		Enter a unique name for the new rule, that clearly describes the purpose. It is useful to include the type of rule in the name, such as "Customization – My App," or "Exclusion – Inactive Users."

	- Description

		Enter text that describes the purpose of the rule and what it does.

	- Arguments and Returns

		These sections list the input variables (Arguments) that can be used in the script, and the return information (Returns). Click on any of the arguments or returns to show more detailed information. These fields cannot be changed in the Rule Editor.

	- Rule Type

		The rule type determines the purpose of the rule and where it can appear in dropdown lists in the IdentityIQ UI. In most cases, the Rule Editor does not allow you to change the Rule Type.

	- Rule Editor

		In the main editor of this UI, enter the BeanShell code for the rule. The rule cannot be saved until some code is entered. Note that no validation is performed; even if the rule is syntactically incorrect, it is accepted and saved. Incorrect rules may result in tasks, workflows or certifications failing to execute, and in errors and large stack traces in the log files.

### 2. Rule XML import
Rules can be written externally, through an IDE or text editor, and imported into the IdentityIQ instance. Standalone XML objects and imported into IdentityIQ through the **gear > Global Settings > Import from File** option, or through the IdentityIQ console, using the iiq console **import** command. A single rule XML file can contain one or more rules. The logic for the rule is written in BeanShell, but it must also be wrapped in an XML document

XML Structure: 

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>  
    <!DOCTYPE Rule PUBLIC "sailpoint.dtd" "sailpoint.dtd">
    
	    <Rule>
    
	    </Rule>
    
    
   ## Printing the beanshell namespace
   If you’re unsure about what variables are available to your rule or script, you can use the snippet of BeanShell shown below to figure it out. This logic prints the name and value of each variable in the BeanShell namespace – in other words, all the variables known to BeanShell at that point in time.
   

    System.out.println("Beanshell namespace:");

    for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; this.variables.length ; i++) {
       String name = this.variables[i];
       if ("transient".equals(name)) { continue; } 
       Object value = eval(name);
       if (value == void)
           print(name + " = void");
       else if (value == null)
           print(name + " = null");
       else
           print(name + ": " + value.getClass().getSimpleName() + " = " + value);
    }

so, you iterate over this.variables and use eval() over each item. You can print this object xml. 

## What are Rule Libraries?
Many rule objects are just a single block of code, executed together as a unit. But IdentityIQ also allows you to create rule objects that contain multiple separate functions or methods. These are called rule libraries.

Rule libraries are a way you can manage collections of methods that can be accessed from within other rules. These can help promote code re-use.

If you find yourself continually writing the same segment of code over and over again, consider including that logic in a rule library, so you can access it from other rules. If you ever need to change it, you can change it in one place and have it changed everywhere automatically. As a best practice for artifact management, you should group related methods together in a rule library, creating as many rule libraries as you need for different logical groupings.

 

    <Rule name='Active Directory Utility'>
	   <Source>
	      public List getAppLinks(String appName, String nativeId) { // do stuff }
	      public String getAttributeOnLink(Link link) { // do stuff and return a String } 
	   </Source>
	</Rule>

To use this method in a rule, you need to include a reference to the Rule Library in the XML of that rule with a <ReferencedRules> element, then in the body of the rule itself, you can call the getAppLinks method or the  getAttributeOnLink and the system will find it in the rule library and execute its code.

    <Rule…>
	   <ReferencedRules>
	       <Reference class='Rule' name='Active Directory Utilit'/>
	   </ReferencedRules>
	   <Source>
	       getAppLinks(appName, String nativeId);
	       getAttributeOnLink(link);
	   </Source>
	</Rule>
IdentityIQ includes some rule libraries that are used by the **default** workflows. Examples of rule libraries are **Workflow Library, Approval Library, and LCM Workflow Library**	

## How are Rules executed?

### Debug 
- available on debug.jsf page. Note that println or logger statements are written to log file and not printed or displayed on output screen. Only returned output is displayed. Can only pass log and context. Doesn't have any option to pass any other argument. If rules need other values, one will need to hardcode that in the body of the rule. 
### IIQ Console 
- Runs as a command line interface. Loggers and print statements are displayed on the CLI window. You could provide additional attributes as arguments in an xml attributes map file rather than hardcoding them
 ### Rule runner task  
- There’s also a built-in task that allows you to set up stand-alone rules to run on a schedule. To do this, you:

	1.  Create a task from the Run Rule task type
	2.  Specify what rule it should run
	3.  Provide arguments to the rule if needed.

- The value returned from a rule is reported in the task results as its result status. This task type can 	speed up the process of implementing custom scheduled actions.
